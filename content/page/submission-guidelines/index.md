## How to Submit a Blog Post

### Overview

The Genomics × AI blog uses a Git-native, PR-based submission workflow. All submissions go through peer review before the post goes live.

### Submission Process

1. **Write Your Post**  
   - Use the [blog post template](https://github.com/genomicsxai/genomicsxai.github.io/blob/main/docs/blog-post-template.md) (copy the frontmatter and adapt)  
   - Conduct internal lab review first  
   - Ensure all required frontmatter fields are complete  

2. **Create a Pull Request**  
   - Fork the repository  
   - Add your post to `content/blogs/YYYY-NNN/index.md`  
   - Create a PR with the submission template filled out  

3. **Editor Review**  
   - Editors will review your submission  
   - They may request changes via PR comments  
   - Address feedback and update your PR  

4. **Going live**  
   - Once approved, editors will merge your PR  
   - The post will be automatically deployed via GitHub Actions  
   - Your post will appear on the blog  

### Writing Note

There is no strict criteria on the style that your blog post should follow but aim to make it clear and engaging!
