## Editorial and Community Policies

The Genomics × AI blog follows transparent, Git-native policies for submissions, review, and discussion.

### Submission and Review

- All posts are submitted via **Pull Request** and require **at least one editor approval** before merge.  
- Authors are expected to complete lab-internal review before submitting.  
- Editors review for suitability, scientific accuracy, and adherence to [Submission Guidelines](/submission-guidelines/).  

### Access and Permissions

- **Authors**: Submit and revise posts via PRs.  
- **Editors**: Review, request changes, and merge to `main`. Implemented via GitHub branch protection and the [@genomicsxai/editors](https://github.com/orgs/genomicsxai/teams/editors) team (CODEOWNERS).  
- **Readers**: View content and participate in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/genomicsxai/genomicsxai.github.io/discussions).  

### Code of Conduct and Reuse

- Content is published under the site’s default license (see footer or per-post notices).  
- By submitting, you confirm you have the rights to publish the content and that it meets our [Submission Guidelines](/submission-guidelines/).  

### Changes to These Policies

Policy updates are proposed and discussed via the repository (e.g. issues or discussions) and reflected in this page after consensus.
